        <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>

        <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
        
        <p>We retain your information only as long as necessary:</p>

            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> Retained until you delete your account (see Section 7)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        
        <p>We take security seriously and implement industry-standard measures to protect your information:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data transmitted between the app and our servers is encrypted using TLS/SSL</li>
            <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized personnel can access your data, and only when necessary</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Servers:</strong> Our backend infrastructure follows best practices for data protection</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> When Stripe is integrated, all payment data is handled according to PCI DSS standards</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>However, no system is 100% secure.</strong> While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. Please use strong passwords and keep your account credentials confidential.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <p>You have control over your personal information. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under laws like CCPA (California), GDPR (EU/UK), or Florida state law.</p>
        
        <h3>6.1 Access Your Data</h3>
        <p>You can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</p>
        
        <h3>6.2 Correct Your Data</h3>

            <li>You can request expedited deletion by contacting us</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Reply "STOP" to any marketing SMS</li>
            <li>Adjust your notification preferences in the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.5 California Residents (CCPA Rights)</h3>

            <li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> We don't sell your data, so this doesn't apply—but you can rest easy!</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We won't discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>JunkOS is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we'll delete it.</p>

        <h2>8. Location Services & Permissions</h2>
        
        <p>JunkOS requires location access to function properly:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> To verify service area and determine pickup location</li>
            <li><strong>When:</strong> Only when you're actively using the app (not in the background)</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable location access in your device settings, but this will prevent you from booking services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We also request camera access to take photos of items for removal. You can decline, but you'll need to provide photos another way.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>
        
        <p>JunkOS may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., our website or social media). This Privacy Policy only applies to JunkOS—we're not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. Please review their privacy policies before providing any information.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. When we do:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top</li>
            <li>For significant changes, we'll notify you via email or in-app notification</li>
            <li>Your continued use of JunkOS after changes means you accept the updated policy</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>11. International Users</h2>
        
        <p>JunkOS is based in Florida, USA, and our servers are located in the United States. If you use JunkOS from outside the U.S., your information will be transferred to and processed in the U.S., which may have different data protection laws than your country.</p>
        
        <p>By using JunkOS, you consent to this transfer.</p>

        <h2>12. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        
        <p>Some browsers have "Do Not Track" (DNT) features. JunkOS does not currently respond to DNT signals because there's no industry standard for how to interpret them. We don't track you across websites anyway!</p>
