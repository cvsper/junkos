## 7. Children's Privacy

JunkOS is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we'll delete it.

## 8. Location Services & Permissions

JunkOS requires location access to function properly:

- **Why:** To verify service area and determine pickup location
- **When:** Only when you're actively using the app (not in the background)
- **Control:** You can disable location access in your device settings, but this will prevent you from booking services

We also request camera access to take photos of items for removal. You can decline, but you'll need to provide photos another way.

---

## 9. Third-Party Links

JunkOS may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., our website or social media). This Privacy Policy only applies to JunkOS—we're not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. Please review their privacy policies before providing any information.

---

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. When we do:

- We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- For significant changes, we'll notify you via email or in-app notification
- Your continued use of JunkOS after changes means you accept the updated policy

We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

---

## 11. International Users

JunkOS is based in Florida, USA, and our servers are located in the United States. If you use JunkOS from outside the U.S., your information will be transferred to and processed in the U.S., which may have different data protection laws than your country.

By using JunkOS, you consent to this transfer.

---

## 12. Do Not Track Signals

Some browsers have "Do Not Track" (DNT) features. JunkOS does not currently respond to DNT signals because there's no industry standard for how to interpret them. We don't track you across websites anyway!
