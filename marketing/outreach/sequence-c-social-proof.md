## Email 1: "Why 500+ hauling companies switched"

**Subject:** Why 500+ haulers switched

Hi {{name}},

Over 500 junk removal and hauling companies have switched to Umuve in the past year. Most from {{city}} and similar markets.

The #1 reason? They were tired of losing jobs to competitors with faster quotes and tighter operations.

Umuve isn't fancy — it just handles quotes, dispatch, and invoicing so you can focus on the actual work.

Want to see why companies like {{company}} are making the switch?

Best,

## Email 2: "[Local competitor] increased revenue 23%"

**Subject:** {{city}} success story

{{name}},

Wanted to share a local example:

A {{city}}-based hauler (similar size to {{company}} — {{truck_count}} trucks) implemented Umuve last fall. In Q4 alone:
- Revenue up 23%
- Quote-to-booking rate improved from 34% → 51%
- Admin time cut in half

They're not special. They just automated the boring stuff so they could take more jobs.

Worth 15 minutes to see if {{company}} could do the same?

## Email 3: "Can I show you how?"

**Subject:** Can I show you?

Hi {{name}},

This is my last follow-up.

You're probably busy (running {{truck_count}} trucks isn't easy), so I'll make this simple:

**5-minute screen share. Your schedule. Zero pressure.**

I'll show you exactly how companies in {{city}} are using Umuve to close more jobs and cut admin chaos. If it's not a fit, we'll part as friends.

Reply with a day/time and I'll send a Zoom link.

Cheers,

PS — If you're not interested, totally cool. Just reply "not now" and I'll stop reaching out.
