## Email 1: "Losing jobs because of slow quotes?"

**Subject:** Losing jobs because of slow quotes?

Hi {{name}},

Quick question for {{company}} — how often do you lose jobs because someone else got their quote in faster?

Most haulers in {{city}} tell us they're typing the same info into spreadsheets 10+ times per day. The winner isn't always the best operator — just the fastest quote.

JunkOS generates quotes in 30 seconds. Live pricing, instant PDF, done.

Worth a 10-minute look?

Best,

## Email 2: "How [competitor] reduced no-shows by 40%"

**Subject:** How Austin Haulers cut no-shows by 40%

{{name}},

Saw you didn't get a chance to respond — no worries.

I wanted to share something relevant: Austin Haulers was losing $3K/month to no-shows and last-minute cancellations.

They started using JunkOS's automated reminders (SMS + email). No-shows dropped 40% in the first 60 days. Now their {{truck_count}}-truck operation runs tighter than ever.

Figured {{company}} might face similar challenges.

Want to see how they did it?

## Email 3: "Quick question about your dispatch process"

**Subject:** Quick question

Hi {{name}},

Last one from me — promise.

Just curious: what's your current dispatch process look like? Are you using software, or still juggling spreadsheets and group texts?

No pitch here. If you're happy with your setup, that's genuinely great. But if dispatch chaos is eating your day, I can show you a 5-minute fix.

Reply with "show me" and I'll send a quick demo.

Cheers,  
[Your Name]
