# Sequence B: Benefit-Focused

## Email 1: "3 trucks to 10 trucks in 18 months"

**Subject:** 3 trucks → 10 trucks in 18 months

{{name}},

Mike at DFW Hauling started with 3 trucks in {{city}}, same as {{company}}.

18 months later? 10 trucks and booked solid 6 days a week.

His secret wasn't marketing — it was operations. JunkOS automated his quotes, dispatch, and invoicing. He went from firefighting admin work to actually growing his business.

Think {{company}} could use that extra time?

Happy to show you his playbook.

Best,

## Email 2: "See JunkOS in action (2-min video)"

**Subject:** 2-minute JunkOS demo

Hi {{name}},

Following up on my last email about scaling operations.

Instead of a long pitch, I recorded a 2-minute screen share showing exactly how JunkOS handles:
- 30-second quotes
- GPS dispatch for {{truck_count}} trucks
- Auto-invoicing after job completion

Watch it here: [demo link]

If it clicks, we can chat. If not, no hard feelings.

## Email 3: "Free trial + setup call?"

**Subject:** Free trial?

{{name}},

Last ping — want to offer {{company}} something concrete:

**Free 14-day trial + 30-minute setup call**

No credit card. No commitment. I'll personally get you configured for {{city}} pricing, import your customer list, and walk your team through day 1.

If it doesn't save you 5+ hours in the first week, just delete it.

Sound fair?

Reply "let's try it" and I'll get you started Monday.
