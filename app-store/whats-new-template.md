## Best Practices for "What's New"

1. **Lead with the biggest feature**: Users skim—put the most exciting update first
2. **Use emojis strategically**: 1 per section for visual scanning
3. **Benefits > Features**: Don't just say what it does; explain why it matters
4. **Keep it scannable**: Use headers, bullets, short paragraphs
5. **Acknowledge users**: "Based on your feedback..." shows you're listening
6. **Include fixes**: Users appreciate knowing bugs are being addressed
7. **Build anticipation**: Tease upcoming features when appropriate
8. **Call-to-action**: Encourage ratings/reviews in every update
9. **Contact info**: Always provide a way to reach support
10. **Tone**: Enthusiastic but professional; avoid over-hype
