## Design Guidelines

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Most important**: Screenshots 1-4 (Hero, Photo, Pricing, Booking)
2. **Supporting**: Screenshots 5-6 (Tracking, Completion)
3. **Optional**: Screenshot 7 (Features list)

### Caption Best Practices
- **Character limit**: ~30-40 characters for primary caption
- **Font size**: Large, readable even in small preview
- **Contrast**: Ensure text is legible on all backgrounds
- **Consistency**: Use same font/style across all screenshots
- **Actionable**: Use verbs ("Snap," "Book," "Track")

### Visual Elements to Include
✓ Real UI from the app (not mockups)
✓ Relatable junk items (furniture, boxes, appliances)
✓ Clear CTAs and buttons visible
✓ Realistic pricing examples ($100-$400 range)
✓ Map with recognizable city/streets
✓ Professional driver photo/rating
✓ Clean, uncluttered screenshots

### What to Avoid
✗ Screenshots with personal info visible
✗ Overly staged or fake-looking scenarios
✗ Text too small to read in preview
✗ Too many screens (7 max recommended)
✗ Repetitive screens (show variety)

## Screenshot Localization Notes

For international markets, consider:
- **Currency**: Display local currency in pricing screenshots
- **Language**: Translate all UI text in screenshots
- **Context**: Use regionally appropriate junk items (e.g., different furniture styles)
- **Regulations**: Ensure disposal/recycling messaging aligns with local laws

---

## A/B Testing Recommendations

Test different screenshot orders:
- **Order A**: Hero → Photo → Price → Book → Track → Complete
- **Order B**: Photo → Price → Hero → Book → Track → Complete
- **Order C**: Problem → Solution (Photo) → Price → Book → Track

Monitor conversion rates and adjust based on which order performs best in different markets.
