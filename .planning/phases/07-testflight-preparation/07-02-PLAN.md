<objective>
Create privacy policy page and prepare App Store Connect metadata for both apps.

Purpose: Apple requires a privacy policy URL for all TestFlight external testing and App Store submissions. App Store Connect also requires descriptions, keywords, categories, and screenshots. Preparing metadata now avoids blocking the upload process.

Output: Privacy policy HTML page ready for deployment, App Store metadata document for both apps.
